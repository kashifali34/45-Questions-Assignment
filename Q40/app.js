// Album: Write a function called make_album() that builds a Object describing a music album. 
// The function should take in an artist name and an album title,
//  and it should return a Object containing these two pieces of information. 
//  Use the function to make three dictionaries representing different albums.
//   Print each return value to show that Objects are storing the album information correctly. 
//   Add an optional parameter to make_album() that allows you to store the number of tracks on an album.
//    If the calling line includes a value for the number of tracks, add that value to the albumâ€™s Object. 
//    Make at least one new function call that includes the number of tracks on an album.
